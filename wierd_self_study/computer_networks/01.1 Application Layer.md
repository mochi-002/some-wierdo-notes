## 1. Introduction to the Application Layer

### Application Layer Programs
- Run **exclusively** on **end systems** (hosts, clients, servers)
- Network-core devices (**routers, switches**) **do not** run user applications

**Common Examples**:
- Web browsing
- Email
- File sharing
- Text messaging
- Multi-user network games
- Streaming stored video (YouTube, Netflix, etc.)

### Common Application Layer Protocols
| Protocol       | Main Purpose                  | Typical Use Case          |
|----------------|-------------------------------|---------------------------|
| HTTP / HTTPS   | HyperText Transfer Protocol   | Web browsing              |
| FTP            | File Transfer Protocol        | File upload/download      |
| SMTP           | Simple Mail Transfer Protocol | Sending email             |
| IMAP / POP3    | Receiving email protocols     | Email retrieval           |
| DNS            | Domain Name System            | Domain name resolution    |

## 2. Application Architectures

### 2.1 Client-Server Architecture

| Feature               | Server                              | Client                           |
| --------------------- | ----------------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Always-on             | Yes                                 | No (intermittent)                |
| IP address            | Permanent / static                  | Usually dynamic                  |
| Scalability           | Server must scale                   | No scaling role                  |
| Data management       | Centralized                         | Distributed                      |
| Communication pattern | Clients communicate with Server     | Clients do **not** talk directly |
| Typical examples      | Web servers, YouTube, email servers | Browsers, email clients, apps    |

### 2.2 Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Architecture

| Feature          | Description                                                 |
| ---------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------- |
| Node role        | Each node acts as **both client and server**                |
| Communication    | **Direct** peer-to-peer                                     |
| Always online    | No – intermittent connections                               |
| IP address       | Usually dynamic & frequently changing                       |
| Scalability      | Self-scalable (more peers → more resources)                 |
| Data management  | Fully distributed                                           |
| Complexity       | Higher (peer discovery, security, churn management)         |
| Typical examples | BitTorrent, early Skype, some blockchain/decentralized apps |

### 2.3 Quick Comparison Table

| Feature                   | Client-Server         | Peer-to-Peer (P2P)               |
| ------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Always-on server          | Yes                   | No                               |
| Centralized control       | Yes                   | No                               |
| Direct peer communication | No                    | Yes                              |
| Self-scalability          | Limited               | Excellent                        |
| Management complexity     | Lower                 | Higher                           |
| Typical real-world use    | Web, Email, Streaming | File sharing, decentralized apps |

## 3. Process-to-Process Communication

     width="580"
     style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">
### 3.1 Basic Concepts
- **Process**: A program running within a host
- Processes on different hosts communicate by exchanging **messages**

### 3.2 Roles in Each Architecture
- **Client-Server**:
  - **Client process**: Initiates communication (e.g., web browser)
  - **Server process**: Waits passively to be contacted (e.g., web server)
- **Peer-to-Peer**:
  - Each participating host runs **both** client and server processes

### 3.3 Addressing Processes – Sockets
- Processes communicate via **sockets**
- **Socket identifier** = **IP address** + **Port number**

**Well-Known Port Examples**:
- HTTP: 80
- HTTPS: 443
- SMTP: 25
- DNS: 53
<img src="Pasted image 20251228221552.png"
     width="580"
     style="display: block; margin: 0 auto;">

**Real Example**:
To reach the web server at gaia.cs.umass.edu:
- IP address: 128.119.245.12
- Port: 80  
→ Full socket: **128.119.245.12:80**

## 4. Application-Layer Messaging

Application protocols define four key aspects of messages:

1. **Types of messages** exchanged  
   (e.g., request vs response)
2. **Message syntax**  
   (fields in the message and their structure/order)
3. **Message semantics**  
   (meaning of the information in each field)
4. **Rules**  
   (when and how processes send and respond to messages)

## 5. Services Required by Applications (from Transport Layer)

| Application                                               | Data Loss Tolerance | Throughput (Bandwidth) Requirements        | Time Sensitivity (Delay)              | Typical Transport Protocol |
| --------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------- | -------------------------- |
| **File transfer**                                         | No loss allowed     | Elastic (as much as possible)              | No                                    | TCP                        |
| **Email**                                                 | No loss allowed     | Elastic                                    | No                                    | TCP                        |
| **Web documents** (HTTP/HTTPS)                            | No loss allowed     | Elastic                                    | No (but lower is better)              | TCP                        |
| **Real-time audio/video** (e.g., VoIP, live streaming)    | Loss-tolerant       | Audio: ~5–100 kbps Video: ~10 kbps–5+ Mbps | Yes (very low delay, ~100s of msec)   | UDP (often with RTP)       |
| **Stored audio/video** (e.g., YouTube, Netflix on-demand) | Loss-tolerant       | Same as above (~10 kbps–5+ Mbps)           | Somewhat (few seconds buffering OK)   | TCP or UDP + adaptive      |
| **Interactive games**                                     | Loss-tolerant       | Few kbps upstream/downstream               | Yes (very low, tens to few 100s msec) | Usually UDP                |
| **Text messaging** (e.g., WhatsApp, SMS over IP)          | No loss allowed     | Elastic (very low bandwidth needed)        | Somewhat (100s of msec acceptable)    | TCP                        |

## 6. Application-Layer Security

- **TCP** and **UDP** provide **no encryption** by default
- **Solution**: **SSL/TLS** (Secure Sockets Layer / Transport Layer Security)  
  → Implemented **at the application layer**

**What SSL/TLS provides**:
- Encrypted TCP connection
- Data integrity (tamper detection)
- End-point authentication

**Visible result**:
- Websites using SSL/TLS → **HTTPS** in URL + padlock icon  
- Example:  
  `https://www.google.com` → secure  
  `http://example.com` → insecure
