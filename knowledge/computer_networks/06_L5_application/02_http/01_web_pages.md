## Introduction to Web Pages

- A **web page** consists of **Objects**
- An **Object** can be:
    - HTML file
    - JPEG image
    - Audio file
    - etc.
- A web page consists of a **base HTML-file** which includes several **referenced objects**
- Each object is addressable by a **Unified Resource Locator (URL)**
- **Host name** is translated to server **IP address** using the **Domain Name System (DNS)**

**Example URL:**

```
www.someschool.edu/someDept/pic.gif
└─────┬──────────┘└───────┬───────┘
    host name         path name
```
