# The three major programming paradigms

## procedural programming
- The goal is to do one simple thing and to do it really well in an easy-to-­follow linear format.

## object-oriented programming
- How to tackle complexity with upfront planning and simulating the problem you are trying to tackle using objects that can inherit, take many forms, and be represented in an abstract way.

## functional programming
- How to tackle complex problem sets using a series of chainable expressions with no side effects to eliminate the possibility of semantic errors in your code.

This paradigm proved to be less verbose than its counterparts.

While each of these programming paradigms represented their own strengths and weaknesses, it is important that you understand that no single paradigm can be considered a silver bullet.

When choosing a paradigm, ensure that you are using the right tool for the job rather than the paradigm you like the most or are most familiar with.

The best software engineers are those who can see the advantages of each paradigm and can identify the best time to use each.
